              <b>Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)</b> is an investment strategy that
              consists in periodically buying smaller quantities of a target
              asset (instead of a lump sum buy).
            </Typography>

            <Typography sx={{ mt: 0.25 }}>
              By doing smaller buys in periodic intervals, investors smoothly
              navigate through the storms of volatility

              <b>BTFDCA</b> is a service for long-term investors to buy their
              favorite crypto assets with DCA. Just set up a buy order, and
              ensure that your wallet is topped-up - BTFDCA takes care of the
              rest.
